Each csv has 5 columns: video link, primary tag, secondar tag, description, and rating.Video link colum contains the youtube links of the ads tagged for that country. Primary tag represents the main tag given to that video from 4 primary tags: child directed, irrelevant, inappropriate, and inaudible. Secondary tag were further, slighty more specific tags given to each primary tag. A detailed codebook was made before tagging, as a rubric to be used by each coder. The description colum is a short descrition/summary of the specific ad given by the coder. Lastly, the rating tag was only used when the primary tag was inappropriate.

# Youtube-Kids-Ad

This project involves analyzing ads that play on kids content on Youtube.
We aim to collect data from the most popular videos on Youtube and assess their appropriateness and relevance for child viewership (children aged 0-9).

Folders present in this repo:
- Analysis notebooks: contains all the jupyter notebooks we used to cleaning and analysing our data
- Codebook: contains csv files with the video ads we tagged 
- Data csvs: cleaned up csv files which we obtained after parsing our raw data
- Scripts: scripts we used for making our initial labelled datset + code used for web scraping
